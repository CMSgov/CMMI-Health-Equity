# CMS Innovation Center Health Equity Repository

Welcome to the CMS Innovation Center's Health Equity repository.

As outlined in the [CMS Innovation Center 2021 Strategy Refresh](https://innovation.cms.gov/strategic-direction-whitepaper), one of the Innovation Centerâ€™s objectives is to Advance Health Equity (Objective 2). In order to do so, the Innovation Center will be requiring model participants to collect and report demographic data of their beneficiaries and, as appropriate, data on social needs, and social determinants of health. To support model participants in collecting these data, the Innovation Center is exploring methods to streamline how participants capture and share these data.

In this repository, you will find information on such methods being considered as potentially useful, resources related to each one, along with guidance and suggestions for how to leverage the resources, if desired.

Use of the resources included in this repository is not required at this time, and evaluation of these resource is purely exploratory.

Each CMMI Health Equity based project is contained in their own home folder with their own branch name. Current projects are:

- [FHIR Questionnaire POC](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMMI-Health-Equity/tree/fhir-questionnaire-poc/fhir-questionnaire-poc)
- [Bulk FHIR Export](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMMI-Health-Equity/tree/bulk-fhir-export/bulk-fhir-export)

For any questions about the FHIR Questionnaire or Bulk FHIR Export POCs, please send email to: [CMMI_HE_info@cms.hhs.gov](mailto:CMMI_HE_info@cms.hhs.gov).
